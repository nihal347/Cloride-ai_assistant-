# 🧠 Cloride — Personal AI Assistant

**Cloride** is my personal AI assistant built with **GPT4All**.
This repository is public, but the project is mainly for **my own use**, experiments, and workflow automation.

Cloride is not designed to be polished, user-friendly, or plug-and-play.
It’s built around **my personal preferences**, **my environment**, and **my setup**.

If others want to try it, they can — but that’s not the intention of this project.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* Cloride is **messy**, experimental, and frequently changing.
* Features are implemented for **my device**, **my habits**, and **my workflow**.
* Expect quick hacks, weird shortcuts, and things that break.
* I’m **not** focusing on making it general-purpose or stable for everyone.

---

## 🚧 Current State

Cloride currently:

* Uses **GPT4All** locally
* Runs as a simple CLI assistant
* Is *not* fine-tuned yet
* Contains early logic for my personal automation needs

## 🛠️ Future Plans (All tailored to my personal use)

These are features I plan to add as I turn Cloride into a full personal assistant:

### ✔️ Personalized fine-tuning

Custom fine-tuning based entirely on my own usage patterns and workflows.

### ✔️ Web capabilities

* Basic web scraping
* Searching and retrieving information automatically

### ✔️ System control

Cloride will eventually be able to:

* Control apps on my computer
* Execute OS-level commands
* Automate repetitive tasks
* Interact with softwares I use daily

### ✔️ Visual understanding

A feature where Cloride can:

* Capture screenshots
* Look at any app or code editor
* Explain UI elements, functions, and code
* Help me inside programs without needing built-in APIs

### ✔️ Coding assistant

I’ll use Cloride during development to:

* Answer coding questions
* Explain errors
* Generate snippets
* Assist in any open project

### ✔️ Productivity features

Future tasks include:

* Writing emails
* Searching the web
* Managing files
* Acting as a complete offline personal assistant

## 📌 Notes

* Cloride is **not** meant to be a general-purpose tool.
* Expect rough edges, incomplete features, and changes without notice.
* You can fork it if you want, but it’s built for my environment.
